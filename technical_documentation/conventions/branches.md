# Branch Naming Conventions for the Project

To maintain a clear and organized workflow, our project follows a specific branch naming convention. This ensures that all team members can easily identify the purpose of each branch and track its related issue or feature. The conventions are as follows:

### Branch Naming Structure:

```
type-issue_number/short_description
```

- type: The type of work being done on the branch.
- issue_number: The identifier of the related issue (if applicable).
- short_description: A brief, descriptive name indicating the purpose of the branch.

### [Types of Branches](./commits.md#types-of-commits)

### Examples of Branch Names:

```
feature-45/user-authentication
```

```
hotfix/101-critical-security-patch
```
