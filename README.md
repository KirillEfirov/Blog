# My Awesome Blog Application

Welcome to my blog application repository! This project is aimed at creating a full-fledged blog platform with separate backend and frontend implementations. The backend will be developed using Ruby on Rails, while the frontend will be built with React.

## Why a Blog Application?

![Image](./technical_documentation/design/main_page/ai%20main-page-structure[0].jpeg)

I do believe that blogging is an excellent way to communicate ideas, share knowledge, and engage with a community. By building this blog application, I aim to provide myself and others with a customizable, feature-rich platform for publishing articles, managing content, and interacting with readers. Additionally, developing this project allows me to deepen my understanding of both Rails and React, two technologies I'm enthusiastic about.
